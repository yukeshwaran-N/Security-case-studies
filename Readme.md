# Security Case Studies

This repository contains **generalized and anonymized security case studies**
focused on **risk analysis, abuse scenarios, and mitigation strategies**
across modern web and account-based systems.

The intent of this work is to demonstrate **security judgment, analytical
thinking, and clear communication**, rather than to disclose vulnerabilities
in any specific organization or product.

---

## Scope and Intent

Each case study examines:
- Expected user behavior and assumptions
- System behavior that diverges from those expectations
- How such gaps can be abused quietly or at scale
- The resulting impact on users, trust, and the business
- Practical, risk-driven remediation approaches

The emphasis is on **decision-making and impact**, not exploitation techniques.

## Disclaimer

All content in this repository is:
- Fully anonymized and generalized
- Not associated with any specific company, product, or real-world incident
- Free of exploit code, payloads, endpoints, or sensitive information

No systems were exploited or harmed.
This material is intended solely for **educational and professional discussion**.

---

## Topics Covered

The case studies span multiple security domains, including:

- Authentication and session lifecycle risks  
- Authorization and access control failures  
- Abuse-at-scale and fraud-enabling scenarios  
- User safety and trust implications  
- Detection and visibility gaps  
- Risk-driven remediation strategies  

---

## Rationale

Security roles at organizations operating at scale require more than technical knowledge.

They require the ability to:
- Evaluate real-world risk
- Consider user safety and trust
- Communicate effectively with engineering and product teams
- Balance prevention, detection, and business impact

This repository reflects that approach to security thinking.

---

## Intended Audience

- Security analysts and engineers  
- Trust, safety, and fraud teams  
- Early-career professionals developing security judgment  

Reviewers are encouraged to focus on the **reasoning and trade-offs**
presented in each case study.

---

## Usage Notes

Readers may find it useful to:
1. Review the failure scenario
2. Identify perceived risks independently
3. Compare those assessments with the mitigation strategies provided

This mirrors how security teams evaluate risk in practice.
